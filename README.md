# From0To23

This is an introduction to a program that you can check whether the time point at the time range or not.

1.  When you enter the page, first, you must set the time range in hours. (Input number 0-23)
2.  Click "set" and then you will enter the checked page. If you click "Clear", it will clear fields that you input.
3.  When you see "The time range is..." and the numbers pictures that are the same with the numbers you input, 
	 Congratulations! You succeed in setting time range. (And it will be put on **Time range record**.)
4.	 Now you can start to check the time point. Please input a number from 0 to 23 and click "check" of red button.
5.  If the time point at the range, it will show the msg "True!!! Congratulation :)", else if it out of range, the msg will be "False!!! Maybe you should try again...".
6.	 If you got the msg "Input invalid!!! Please input the correct time.", it mean that you input the wrong number.(More then 23 or less than 0 or NOT number...etc.)
7.  Whatever it's at the range, the time point you input will be put on **Time point record** after check.
8.  You can select the item in "Time range record" to search the records in the past time.
9.  You can click "Clear Record" to delete all the records on  "Time range record" and "Time point record".
10. You can click "Change Range" to return to previous page and set time range again.
11. If you refresh page, and all the records will be cleared.
